## Create a GitHub repository
> Note: The following happens on your local machine. <br>Use your favourite text editor for the following. I prefer VS Code. |

Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. 

We are going to use Git for version control and we will host our repository on GitHub. The server will later `git pull` from GitHub whenever it should update.

Log onto https://github.com. Under Repositories, add a new private repository called `example-com` (you should of course replace `example-com` with your own domain). Initialize the repository with a README or add it later, it doesn't matter much. 

Once created, copy the URL to your repository and open your terminal. 
Run the commands: 

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/example-com
    cd example-com

This is where we will be writing all the code that goes onto our server. In fact, letâ€™s do the same on the server immediately. SSH into your server and run the following: 

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/example-com
    cd example-com

Close the SSH server session and go back to your local terminal.
